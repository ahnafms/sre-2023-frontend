      "Hello everyone! I'm Dani Irfani, and I’m deeply interested in sustainable and clean energy sources. Addressing climate change is a complex and ongoing challenge that requires collaborative efforts. Joining SRE ITS provides me with the opportunity to contribute to a greener, more sustainable future, provides access to ongoing learning and development opportunities to stay up-to-date with industry trends. SRE ITS is a platform to learn and explore the potential research and developments of the technology and policy in the renewable energy sector. Being a part of SRE ITS during my college years stands as my most significant achievement. For me, SRE ITS not only offers theoretical knowledge but also practical involvement in real project implementation. This hands-on experience, coupled with comprehensive knowledge, is crucial for leading renewable energy solutions in current issues. Apart from gaining insights into renewable energy, I've also developed soft skills, time management, and event management. Networking and continuous learning hold significant importance for me, and SRE ITS facilitates both. The most impressive thing was when I had the opportunity to participate in activities organized by SRE Universitas Indonesia. That was the time when I met SRE members throughout Indonesia. Additionally, SRE ITS frequently collaborates with major companies like PLN, Pertamina, and Astra International. The supportive, healthy, and professional work environment further enhances our collective performance. I am truly grateful to be part of this exceptional organization.",

      'SRE ITS provided more than just knowledge for me. But it provides a series of experiences that can help me have a career in this world of college. As a member of the competition I was able to compete in prestigious competitions and get prestigious mentors as well, the competition also opened my interest in the field of research in renewable energy. Until now, even SRE ITS provides an opportunity for us to upload our research with organizations such as RDI which makes me continue to want to explore renewable energy knowledge and research, especially in Outlook authorship',

      'As one of the biggest student chapters in ITS, SRE ITS gave me more than I expected the first time I applied for membership during my freshman year. SRE ITS makes sure to open up my horizons of knowledge related to new and renewable energy to be wider. More than that, SRE ITS actually invited me to be a direct part of this big mission. As an organization, SRE ITS gave me the opportunity to be dedicated and expand my leadership and problem solving skills. SRE ITS gave me the trust and lifted my head to see the magnitude of my potential.
